[![PPL Document](PPL/PPL-Logo-small.png)](https://github.com/PeacefulPublicLicense/peaceful-public-license-pdf/blob/main/Peaceful_Public_License.pdf)

Welcome to the Peaceful Public License (PPL) repository. This license is designed to empower creators, artists, and innovators by ensuring that their work is used ethically, with a strong focus on protecting peaceful, creative, and collaborative pursuits.

### What is the Peaceful Public License?

The Peaceful Public License (PPL) provides a framework for creators to share their work under specific conditions, aiming to promote peace, creativity, and fairness. Unlike traditional licenses, the PPL includes protections that align with ethical standards, restricting use in certain applications that could lead to harm or exploitation. This makes it ideal for anyone wanting to protect their creations from misuse while still fostering an open-source community.

### Why Choose the Peaceful Public License?

As an artist, the **Peaceful Public License empowers you to maintain control over your creations in an increasingly automated world**. Unlike conventional licenses, the PPL protects your work from being exploited by AI systems for training or automated derivative generation without your explicit consent, ensuring your creativity remains respected and valued. By using the PPL, you join a community of like-minded creators committed to ethical practices and innovation, while retaining the ability to share your art with others on your own terms. The license also provides a clear, legally enforceable framework that safeguards your rights, enabling you to focus on what matters most - creating meaningful art.

### Key Features

- **Ethical Restrictions**: The PPL specifically prohibits the use of licensed works in surveillance, military, or data brokering, among other restricted activities.
- **Clear Variants**: Multiple versions of the PPL cater to different user needs—whether you're an artist, a developer, or an activist, there’s a PPL variant suited to you.
- **Artist and Legal Guides**: Comprehensive documents explain how artists, lawyers, and advocates can best use the PPL for their purposes.
- **Global Scope**: The PPL is intended to be compatible with multiple open-source licenses and adaptable to international standards, making it a valuable resource worldwide.

### PPL Variants

1. **PPL-Personal**: Aimed at artists, writers, and creators, PPL-Personal encourages the ethical sharing of creative works.
2. **PPL-Community**: For developers and tech enthusiasts, PPL-Community provides a community-centered framework that values transparency and user control.
3. **PPL-Research**: The most restrictive variant, this version includes specific clauses for ethical enforcement to safeguard against misuse.
