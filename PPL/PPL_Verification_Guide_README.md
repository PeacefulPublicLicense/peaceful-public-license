# Peaceful Public License (PPL) Version Verification Guide

To ensure you’re using an official version of the Peaceful Public License (PPL), 
you can verify the authenticity of each version by checking the Git tags associated with each release.

## Verification Steps

1. **Access the Repository**: Visit the official repository at <https://github.com/PeacefulPublicLicense/peaceful-public-license> to access the latest versions of the PPL.

2. **Check for Official Tags**:
   Each official release is marked with a Git tag (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`) to identify the version.
   To view all tags, use:
```bash
   git tag
```
   

3. **Checkout a Specific Version**:
   To verify or use a specific version of the PPL, checkout the desired tag. For example, for version 1.0:
```bash
   git checkout v1.0
```
   

4. **Verify File Integrity**:
   The files in each tagged version remain unaltered to preserve integrity. You can cross-reference the tag with the latest official hash in this repository.

## Additional Notes
