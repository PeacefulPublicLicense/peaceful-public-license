Peaceful Public License (PPL) - Introductory Document
=====================================================

This document introduces the Peaceful Public License (PPL) in three distinct versions—PPL-Personal, PPL-Community, and PPL-Research—each crafted to support responsible, ethical, and peaceful use of creative works.

Why Choose the Peaceful Public License (PPL)?
---------------------------------------------

As an artist, the **Peaceful Public License empowers you to maintain control over your creations in an increasingly automated world**. Unlike conventional licenses, the PPL protects your work from being exploited by AI systems for training or automated derivative generation without your explicit consent, ensuring your creativity remains respected and valued. By using the PPL, you join a community of like-minded creators committed to ethical practices and innovation, while retaining the ability to share your art with others on your own terms. The license also provides a clear, legally enforceable framework that safeguards your rights, enabling you to focus on what matters most - creating meaningful art.


PPL Usage
---------

1. **Purpose and Overview**:
   - The PPL is designed to foster positive contributions to society while protecting creators' rights and ensuring their work aligns with peaceful and socially responsible uses.

2. **Distinctions Between Versions**:
   - **PPL-Personal**: Focused on personal, non-commercial use, ideal for individual study and educational activities.
   - **PPL-Community**: Suitable for community organizations, educational workshops, and other non-commercial activities that align with the work's peaceful mission.
   - **PPL-Research**: Intended for non-commercial academic and research settings, including ethical AI research, with strong protections against misuse.

3. **How to Choose a Version**:
   - Choose **PPL-Personal** if the work is primarily for personal study or individual projects.
   - Opt for **PPL-Community** for broader community applications that benefit educational or non-profit groups.
   - Select **PPL-Research** for research purposes, particularly in academia, where ethical AI considerations are essential.

4. **Ethical and Social Impact**:
   - Each version of the PPL prohibits use in military, surveillance, discriminatory, and unethical AI applications. The license aims to support creativity and progress while preserving peace and respecting human rights.

Recommended Auditing Standards
------------------------------
The Peaceful Public License (PPL) encourages users to select auditors who align with recognized ethical standards in technology, privacy, and open-source compliance. Organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), or the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) represent the type of ethical standards that align with the PPL’s goals for transparency, peace, and responsible use.

License Compatibility
---------------------
The Peaceful Public License (PPL) is designed to be compatible with certain non-commercial open-source licenses that align with its ethical values, such as Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licenses. Users are encouraged to verify that any combined work respects the PPL’s ethical standards, as specified under Ethical Use Obligations. The PPL is not compatible with licenses that permit unrestricted military, surveillance, or commercial uses that would violate the ethical intent of this license.
