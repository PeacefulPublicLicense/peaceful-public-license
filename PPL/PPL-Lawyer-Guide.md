Peaceful Public License (PPL) - Lawyer & Activist's Guide
=========================================================
Version 1.0

Introduction
-------------
The Peaceful Public License (PPL) introduces a new ethical framework designed to protect the intentions of creators and restrict the exploitation of their work for harmful or unethical purposes. 
This guide offers insights into the protections offered by the PPL, its vision, and how it can be effectively applied within a legal framework.

Protections and Ethical Standards
---------------------------------
1. **Prohibiting Exploitative Use:** The PPL explicitly prohibits uses related to military, surveillance, police, and commercial exploitation within unethical industries.
2. **Protection Against Unauthorized AI Model Training:** The PPL prevents the use of licensed works in training AI models without explicit permission, thereby safeguarding creator rights, promoting agency, and ensuring that the benefits of original creation remain with the artist.
3. **Supporting Non-commercial, Open-source Compatibility:** The PPL aligns with certain non-commercial open-source licenses, fostering a cooperative ecosystem for responsible sharing.

Broad Vision and Use Cases
--------------------------
The PPL aims to create a more ethical world where creators can contribute positively without fear of their work being misappropriated. This license is particularly relevant for legal professionals and activists interested in protecting intellectual property from misuse and ensuring compliance with ethical standards.

How to Use the PPL in Legal Systems
-----------------------------------
1. **Understand Compatibility**: Identify compatible non-commercial licenses to ensure seamless integration for clients.
2. **Document Compliance**: Encourage clients to document and communicate compliance to protect their intentions in legal settings.
3. **Promote Ethical Adoption**: Use the PPL's structure as an example to support ethical licensing practices across industries.
