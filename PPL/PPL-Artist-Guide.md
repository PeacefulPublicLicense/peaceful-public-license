Peaceful Public License (PPL) - Artist's Guide
==============================================
Version 1.0

Introduction
------------
The Peaceful Public License (PPL) is designed to support artists by providing a framework that ensures their work can be shared and utilized within ethical boundaries. 
This guide offers insight into the specific benefits of using the PPL, when it may be most valuable, and how to implement it effectively to safeguard your creative work.

Benefits of the PPL for Artists
-------------------------------
1. **Ethical Usage Assurance:** The PPL ensures your work cannot be used for purposes such as military, surveillance, or any application that goes against peaceful and constructive values.
2. **Protection Against AI Training Use:** The PPL prevents the use of your work in training AI models without your express consent, returning agency to you as the creator and preserving the profitability and integrity of your original creations.
3. **Transparency in Licensing:** The PPL's clear terms provide transparency, allowing you to control and communicate your ethical boundaries to collaborators and the public.

When to Use the PPL
-------------------
The PPL is ideal for artists who wish to share their work while ensuring it cannot be co-opted by harmful industries or unethical entities. If your art is intended to inspire, educate, or bring communities together, this license supports your goals without compromising your values.

How to Effectively Use the PPL
------------------------------
1. **Choose the Correct Version**: Depending on your objectives, select the most appropriate version (e.g., Personal, Community, Research) to match the intended use of your work.
2. **Document Your Intentions**: Include a statement or artist note with your work explaining why you chose the PPL and what you hope to achieve.
3. **Communicate with Collaborators**: Inform collaborators about the ethical terms of the PPL and how it affects any derivative works.
